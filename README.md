# BRIE-kit
Preprocessing tool kit of BRIE project in splicing analysis

## Why BRIE-kit
The main motivation is to move some of utility functions into the package, for example the exon skipping events generation, which is only supported by Python 2. Therefore, BRIE main package could focus on splicing quantification and analysis pipeline in single cells, and will be better (aim to fully) supported by Python 2 and Python 3.
